                        <p>Data that needs to be processed or stored is <span>encoded</span> to enter the system. This process involves converting information from <span>analog</span> to <span>digital</span> format so that the computer can effectively <span>process</span> it. Various devices such as the <span>keyboard</span>, <span>mouse</span>, and <span>microphone</span> are commonly used to input data into the system. Some examples of data input situations include <span>uploading files</span>, <span>typing notes</span>, and <span>recording audio</span>.</p>                        
                    <h1 id = "process">Process</h1>
                        <p>Once data is collected, it undergoes various operations to be transformed into useful <span>information</span>. This process is crucial as it allows raw data to be interpreted and utilized effectively. Common examples of how data is processed include <span>searching</span> for specific information within a database, performing <span>calculations</span> to manipulate numerical data, <span>analyzing</span> patterns or trends to gain insights, and <span>converting</span> data from one format to another to ensure compatibility with different systems or applications. These processes are essential to derive meaningful insights and make informed decisions based on the data at hand.</p>                        
                    <h1 id = "storage">Storage</h1>
                        <p><span>Processed data</span> is typically <span>stored</span> for future use to ensure it can be accessed or utilized as needed. In the short term, a computer keeps this information in its primary storage, known as <span>RAM</span>, which allows quick access for ongoing tasks. For long-term storage, information is saved on your computer’s <span>solid-state drive (SSD)</span> or <span>hard disk drive (HDD)</span>. Recently, <span>Cloud Storage</span> has become a popular option, allowing data to be stored online and accessed from most devices with internet connectivity. For offline and portable use, information can be saved on <span>flash drives</span>, providing a convenient way to transfer data between devices.</p>                        
                    <h1 id = "output">Output</h1>
                        <p>After processing, data is presented in formats that align with the user’s specific <span>goals</span>, making it easier to understand and use. Various devices are utilized to <span>display information</span>, including the <span>monitor</span>, <span>printer</span>, and <span>speaker</span>. These devices allow the user to interact with the processed data in different ways. For instance, <span>playing music files</span> through a speaker provides an audio output, while <span>printing word documents</span> using a printer offers a physical copy of the information. Additionally, <span>slideshow presentations</span> displayed on a monitor visually present data to an audience, enhancing communication and comprehension.</p>

This is followed by <span>System Design</span>, where the software is designed through methods such as flowcharts and pseudocode. In <span>Implementation</span>, a working program is made. <span>Testing</span> is essentially checking if the program satisfies the requirements. A way of viewing it is messing around with the program in an attempt to break it, and fixing these. In <span>Deployment</span>, the program is released for the end users. This is done when the program is finalized with no more issues that can be identified. Finally, <span>Maintenance</span> encompasses the upkeep of the program by updating to add new features and modifications, and fixing flaws identified by users.</p>

                        <p>Let's try using the SLDC to create a program to solve something simple. Say we want to make a <span>random number guessing game</span>. For the first step, we identify the goal and requirements of the software:</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Goal: To create a game where the computer selects a random number within a given range, and the user has to guess the number.</p>
                        <p>Requirements:</p>
                        <ul style = "margin-left: 2vw">
                            <li>The program generates a random number from 1 to 100</li>
                            <li>The user enters guesses that have to be integers from 1 to 100 until the correct number is found</li>
                            <li>The program provides feedback on whether or not the guess was too high, too low, or correct</li>
                            <li>The program keeps track of the number of guesses made</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        <p>The second step involves outlining how the code would look like by using something like pseudocode:</p>
                        <ol style = "margin-left: 2vw">
                            <li>Generate a random number between 1 and 100.</li>
                            <li>Initialize attempts to 0.</li>
                            <li>Repeat until the user guesses the correct number:
                                <ol type="a" style = "margin-left: 2vw">
                                    <li>Ask user for an integer input.</li>
                                    <li>If input is not a valid integer, ask again.</li>
                                    <li>Increase attempts by 1.</li>
                                    <li>If input is less than the random number, print "Too low."</li>
                                    <li>If input is greater than the random number, print "Too high."</li>
                                    <li>If input is equal to the random number, print "Congratulations!" and the number of attempts.</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <br>
                        <p>For steps 2 and 3, this program can be coded on a variety of languages such as Python, C++, and Java.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Meanwhile, the final two steps can be done using tools such as GitHub, which allow you to publish and release new versions of your code.</p>

                        <p>There are a lot of types of operators in Python.</p>
                        <p>To begin, let's discuss the most basic one:</p>
                        <h2><span>Arithmetic Operators</span></h2>
                        <pre><code class="language-python">
### Addition is done by using +. This is usually done with the same datatypes so as to not raise a TypeError, but addition between integers and floats is possible.
x = 5
y = 4.0
a = [1, "What?"]
b = [True, 3.14]
print(x + y) # outputs 9.0, so it actually turns the result to a float
print(a + b) # outputs [1, 'What?', True, 3.14]

bool1 = True
bool2 = False
print(bool1 + bool2) # This actually returns 1. The program evaluates True as 1 and False as 0, so 1 + 0 = 1. Actually, the same goes for all other arithmetic operations; True is treated as 1 and False as 0

### Subtraction is done by using -. Like addition, it's usually done with the same datatypes except for ints and floats
print(x - y) # outputs 1.0, likewise turns the result to a float

# In our case, we can't subtract b from a or vice-versa. Subtracting lists with each other is not a thing, at least using -. What we can do is something like:
c = {1, 2, 3, 4}
d = {1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
print(c - d) # outputs {2}

### Multiplication is done by using *. Similar to the last two, multiplying an int to a float turns the result to a float. Some other notable stuff include:
sample_string = "I like turtles"
print(sample_string * 2) # outputs "I like turtlesI like turtles"

sample_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(sample_list * 2) #outputs [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

### Division is done by using /. Dividing an int to a float turns the result to a float. Some other notable stuff include:
print(bool2/bool1) # outputs 0.0
print(20/4) # outputs 5.0

# Floor division is the counterpart of this that returns the floor of the result. It uses //.
print(21//4) # outputs 5

### Modulo is done by using %. It returns the remainder of the division of two numbers. For unsupported types, it will raise a TypeError.
print(17 % -2) # outputs -1
# The example here uses the unary operator (-) to negate 2. You can also do the same with +

print(20 % 2.0) # outputs 0.0

### Exponentiation is done using **. It returns the first number raised to the second number. You can only use it on integers and floats
num1 = 2
num2 = 2
print(2**2) # outputs 4
num1 = 2.0
print(2**2.0) # outputs 4.0

# It's also important to note that you can use parentheses to control the order in which operations are performed, just like in actual mathematics.
answer = answer = (2 + 6) * 8
print(answer) # outputs 64, since it evaluates 2+6 first, then multiplies the result by 8
                        </code></pre>
                        <br>
                        <h2><span>Assignment Operators</span></h2>
                        <p>The next is <span>assignment</span> operators. The best example of this is =, which assigns a value to variables. Aside from it, there are also:</p>
                        <pre><code class="language-python">
random_number = 10

random_number += 10
print(random_number) # outputs 20

random_number -= 5
print(random_number) # outputs 15

random_number *= 2
print(random_number) # outputs 30

random_number /= 5
print(random_number) # outputs 6.0

random_number %= 4
print(random_number) # outputs 2.0

random_number *= 20
print(random_number) # outputs 40.0

random_number //= 7
print(random_number) # outputs 5.0

random_number **= 2
print(random_number) # outputs 25.0

# Essentially, the assignment operators aside from = is broken down as:
# variable1 (operation)= variable2 is the same as variable1 = variable1 (operation) variable2
# So, in random += 10, it's basically saying random = random + 10

                        <h2><span>Comparison Operators</span></h2>
                        <p>The next type of operator is <span>comparison</span> operators, which is very similar to actual comparison operators in real mathematics. It returns a boolean True or False based on the result of the expression.</p>
                        <pre><code  class="language-python">
# A thing worth noting is that these operators is not limited to being used on floats or integers, they can actually also be used in things such as strings or lists

# == compares if the first value is equal to the other
print(5 == 10) # outputs False
print(5 == 5) # outputs True
print("peppa" == "peppa") # outputs True

# != compares if the first value is NOT equal to the other
print(5 != 10) # outputs True
print(5 != 5) # outputs False
print("peppa" != "george") # outputs True

# &lt; and &gt;, compares if the first value is less than or greater than the second value, respectively.
print(5 &lt; 10) # outputs True
print(5 &gt; 10) # outputs False
print(5 &gt; 5) # outputs False

# For strings, python does a comparison for each character and moves onto the next one if the previous are the same. Then, it compares the unicode values of the characters
print("peppa" &lt; "george") # outputs False, since p and g (the first elements of each string) are different, and g = 103, while p = 112
print("jorge" &gt; "jorj") # outputs False, since the first differing elements of the strings is g and j, and g = 103 and j = 106
print("jorj" &lt; "jorje") # outputs True, since Python is going to hit a critical point where the first value has no more characters, and the second still has e. In this case, the longer string is considered greater
# It's crucial to note that since it refers to the unicode values of the characters, it is case sensitive since the lowercase and uppercase of a letter havve different unicode values

# For lists, it also does a lexicographic comparison similar to strings. It looks for the first unique values and compares them.
print([1,2,3,4] &lt; [2,4,6]) # outputs True

# &lt;= and &gt;=, compares if the first value is less than/equal to or greater than/equal to the second value, respectively. It's basically the same as &lt; and &gt; with the extra =
print(5 &lt;= 5) # outputs True
print("jarvis" &gt;= "jarvis") # outputs True

                        <h2><span>Bitwise Operators</span></h2>
                        <p>Finally, <span>bitwise</span> operators are used to do bitwise calculations on integers. The integers are first converted to binary, and the desired operations are done on it.</p>
                        <pre><code  class="language-python">
# In Python, the bitwise operators are AND (&), OR (|), XOR (^), NOT (~), right shift (&gt;&gt;), and left shift (&lt;&lt;)

# &, |, and ^ can all be visualized this way:
'''
Suppose you have two integers, 10 and 7. Their binary representations are as follows:
1010 -> 10
111  -> 7
Since their lengths are not the same, we need to put leading zero/s to the shorter one until they are. Take note that this won't happen if the binary representations are the same length already
1010
0111

For &, it checks through each position and returns a 1 if and only if both values are 1. Thus,
1010
0111
----
0010
10 is the resulting binary representation, which is 2. So, 10 & 7 is equal to 2.

For |, it checks through each position and returns a 1 if at least one of the values is 1. Thus,
1010
0111
----
1111
1111 is the resulting binary representation, which is 15. So, 10 | 7 is equal to 15.

Finally, for ^, it checks through each position and returns a 1 if and only if one of the values is 1.
1010
0111
----
1101
1101 is the resulting binary representation, which is 13. So, 10 ^ 7 = 13.
'''
# For these three operations, the order of the operands does not matter.

# As you may have guessed by now, ~ just gets the binary representation of a number, flips the 1s and 0s, and returns its integer form, but the catch it is evaluates the result using two's complement
print(~7) # this outputs -8
# In a nutshell, using ~ on an integer just returns -(n+1), where n is the integer

# &gt;&gt; and &lt;&lt; shift the binary representation to the right or to the left by a number of units, respectively.
print(10 &gt;&gt; 2) # this outputs 2, since 1010 shifted 2 units to the right is just 10, whose decimal representation is 2
print(10 &lt;&lt; 2) # this outputs 40, since 1010 shifted 2 units to the left is 101000, whose decimal representation is 40

                            </figure>
                        </div>
                        <p>Typically, the four pillars are visualized as literal pillars as shown in Figure 1. Let's break down what each of these pillars mean in Python.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p><span>Abstraction</span> focuses on exposing only the <span>necessary details</span> and hiding the others from the user. It allows you to define a <span>blueprint</span> or interface without getting bogged down by implementation details. In Python, abstraction is achieved through classes and methods, allowing you to model real-world entities with only relevant properties and behaviors. Another example of abstraction is Python libraries, since the user is only told how to use the library, and not necessarily what happens behind the scenes.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p><span>Encapsulation</span> is the concept of bundling data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit, or <span>object</span>. In Python, this is done using <span>classes</span>. Encapsulation essentially wraps the data in a "capsule", such that they cannot be accessed or modified outside of it (unless there are getters and setters, which we'll discuss later on). For example, you can use private variables (by prefixing them with an underscore) to restrict access from outside the class, allowing you to define a clear interface for interacting with the object.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p><span>Inheritance</span> is a mechanism that allows one <span>class</span> (called a <span>child</span> or <span>subclass</span>) to inherit properties and behaviors from another class (called a <span>parent</span> or <span>superclass</span>). This promotes <span>code reuse</span> and helps create a hierarchical relationship between classes. For instance, you can have a parent Gadget class, with specific subclasses such as Phone or Laptop that can inherit common properties and methods from Gadget, while also having the option to have unique behaviors.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p><span>Polymorphism</span> allows different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through a common interface. It enables a single <span>function</span> or <span>method</span> to operate on different types of objects. In Python, polymorphism is often used when a parent class method is overridden in a child class, providing specific behavior for the child while maintaining a consistent interface. This flexibility allows you to use a unified approach to handle different data types and objects, making the code more flexible.</p>
                    <h1 id = "importingLibraries">Importing Libraries</h1>
                        <p>Libraries, also known as modules, are essentially files composed of functions (and sometimes, variables) designed to make your life easier. In order to include a library in our code, we use the <span>import</span> keyword.</p>
                        <p>To demonstrate this, let's compare the implementation of a <span>factorial function</span> on base Python, versus Python with the math library.</p>
                        <div style = "display: flex; width: 100%;">
                            <pre style = "width: 48%; margin-right: 4%"><code class="language-python">
n = int(input())
result = 1
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    result *= i
print(result)
                            </code></pre>
                            <pre style = "width: 48%;"><code class="language-python">
import math
n = int(input())
print(math.factorial(n))


                            </code></pre>
                        </div>
                        <p>As you can see, using the math module to get the factorial is much easier and shorter. There are other libraries available aside from math, which can even be complex stuff such as machine learning.</p>
                        <p>It's also worth noting that you can import multiple libraries on a single program. You are not limited to just one library.</p>
                    <h1 id = "functions">Functions</h1>
                        <p>A <span>function</span> in Python is a block of reusable code designed to perform a specific task. It allows you to organize your code into logical chunks, making it easier to read, test, and maintain. You define a function using the def keyword, followed by the function name and parentheses (), which may contain parameters. A function can return a result using the return statement, or simply perform an action.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>To apply this, let's try to turn our previous square root example into a function.</p>
                        <pre style = "width: 50%"><code class="language-python">
def factorial(n):
result = 1
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    result *= i
return result
                            </code></pre>
                        <p>In this example, our factorial code now becomes reusable. Instead of having to write the same block of code every time we need it, we can just call factorial(n) and get its value.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>As mentioned, it's also possible for functions to simply do an action, such as modify a variable, without actually returning anything.</p>
                        <pre style = "width: 50%"><code class="language-python">
def increment_value(a_dict, key):
    if key in my_dict:
    my_dict[key] += 1
    else:
    my_dict[key] = 1
                        </code></pre>
                        <p>In this example, the function only modifies a value in a given dictionary. It does not return anything.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>A default parameter value may also be set. In this case, if no arguments are given, the default value will automatically be used. The parameter with a default value should be at the end of the list of parameters.</p>
                        <pre style = "width: 50%"><code class="language-python">
def make_name(first_name, last_name, middle_name = ""):

    return name
# sample usages:

name2 = make_name("Harrison", "Ford")
print(name1) # This prints out Chuck E. Cheese

                        </code></pre>
                        <br>
                        <p>Finally, it's possible for a function to not have anything by using the pass keyword as shown below. This can be helpful if you want to put a placeholder for a function you'll work on later in the project.</p>

print(cars[4:2:-1]) # ['convertible', 'coupe']
# Here, it starts at index 4, then goes leftwards until before the element at index 2

                        <h1 id="fileio">File I/O</h1>
                        <p>In Python, File I/O (Input/Output) refers to the reading and writing of files. It's essential when you want your programs to persistently save data, or retrieve data from a file for processing. Python provides several built-in functions for handling file I/O, such as <span>open(), read(), write(),</span> and <span>close()</span>. Let's explore the basics.</p>

                        <h2><span>Opening a File</span></h2>
                        <p>To interact with a file, you first need to open it. Python’s <span>open()</span> function allows you to open a file in different modes:</p>
                        <ul style = "margin-left: 2vw;">
                            <li><span>'r'</span>: Opens the file for reading (default mode).</li>
                            <li><span>'w'</span>: Opens the file for writing (overwrites the file if it already exists).</li>
                            <li><span>'a'</span>: Opens the file for appending (adds data to the end of the file).</li>
                            <li><span>'b'</span>: Opens the file in binary mode (useful for non-text files like images).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <pre><code class="language-python">
# Example of opening a file in read mode
file = open("example.txt", "r")
print(file.read())  # This reads and prints the content of the file
file.close()  # Always close the file after finishing
                        </code></pre>
                        
                        <h2><span>Reading from a File</span></h2>
                        <p>Once a file is opened, you can use various methods to read its contents:</p>
                        <ul style = "margin-left: 2vw;">
                            <li><span>read()</span>: Reads the entire file content.</li>
                            <li><span>readline()</span>: Reads one line at a time.</li>
                            <li><span>readlines()</span>: Returns a list of all the lines in the file.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <pre><code class="language-python">
file = open("example.txt", "r")

# Reading all the content
content = file.read()
print(content)

# Reading line by line
file.seek(0)  # Reset file pointer to the beginning
for line in file:
print(line.strip())  # Prints each line

file.close()
                        </code></pre>
                        
                        <h2><span>Writing to a File</span></h2>
                        <p>To write to a file, you can open it in <span>'w'</span> or <span>'a'</span> mode. Remember that opening a file in write mode will overwrite the entire file.</p>
                        <pre><code class="language-python">
file = open("example.txt", "w")  # Open the file in write mode
file.write("Hello, World!\n")  # Write a line to the file
file.write("This is another line.\n")
file.close()  # Close the file

# Appending to the file
file = open("example.txt", "a")
file.write("Appending a new line!\n")
file.close()

                        <h2><span>Using "with" for File Handling</span></h2>
                        <p>Python provides a better way to handle files using the <span>with</span> statement. It ensures the file is automatically closed after the block is executed, even if exceptions occur.</p>
                        <pre><code class="language-python">
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)  # File is automatically closed after this block
